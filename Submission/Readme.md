# [Object Oriented Programming (SECJ2154)](/.)

## Project 📚 

In this course, each student is required to complete one group [project](#project). Each group is tasked with selecting a system from a list of topics/ case studies. Following that, you will be expected to apply object oriented (OO) concepts to your chosen topics.

- Each student (group member) must create at least one module (or one of the main functions of your proposed system), with that module/function containing at least TWO classes. This means that if you have four members, your group project must have at least eight classes.
- It must implement the following concepts:
    - Encapsulation and data hiding
    - Association: both composition and aggregation
    - Inheritance and Polymorphism
    - Exception handling
- _Note: The more concepts you use, the more marks you will receive._
- Write a comprehensive report (documentation) that includes an objective, a purpose of the system is created, an analysis and design (provide a flow chart to show the proposed system's work flow and UML class diagrams to show all of the objects involved in the system and their relationships), explain the use of OO concepts in the system and highlight the OO concept used in the source code, and User manual, provide a sample of inputs and outputs for each task.

## Submission📥

### Folder Structure
You must place your file in the submission folder. Within the `submission` folder, create a folder called your  `group_name`. Suggested folder structure for the project:

```
📁Submission/sec04_23242
├── 📄readme.md
└── group_name
    ├── 📄readme.md
    ├── 📁files
    ├── 📁images
    └── 📁source-code
```
The folder structure you provided appears to be organized in a hierarchical manner. Here's a description of each component:

- `group_name` is your folder or repository name.
- `readme.md` is a markdown file that serves as the readme for the folder or repository. It usually contains information about the task, workflow, design, and documentation.

Inside the `group_name` folder, you'll find three subdirectories:
  - `files` directory contains report, presentation slide and any other related documents.
  - `images` directory holds image files that are referenced or used within the task or any associated documentation.
  - `source-code` directory contains source code files related to the task, or input files if any.

In summary, this folder structure appears to be organizing a GitHub repository by dividing it into separate sections for different classes. Each task has its own directory, including the md file, along with subdirectories for related files, such as images and source codes.
