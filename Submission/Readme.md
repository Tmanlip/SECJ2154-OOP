# [Object Oriented Programming (SECJ2154)](/.)

## Project 📚 

In this course, each student is required to complete one [project](#project). Each group is tasked with proposing or selecting a system based on the predefined theme or from a list of proposed systems. Following that, you will be expected to apply data structure concepts to your proposed system, which will act as your case study.

<a id="project"></a>
## Project 📌

- Each group must implement **sorting and searching algorithms** in the proposed system (case study).
- Data structure concepts and algorithms must be correctly implemented using the **C++ programming language**.
- Determine the relevant classes/ structs associated with the proposed system. Each class/ struct must contain **at least five attributes (data)**.
- Perform sorting and searching on the array of objects/ structs. You have the freedom to select appropriate sorting and searching methods and algorithms.
- Your program should give users a variety of options for sorting and searching. For example:
```cpp
<<< Sorting Process >>>
[1] By name
[2] By age
[3] By IC number
Option: ____
```
- **_Notes:_**
    - _Sort and search based on certain criteria/ keys._
    - _Your program should provide an easy-to-use menu._
    - _Use an input file to get data for your program._ 

- Write a comprehensive report (documentation) that includes an objective, a synopsis, a design (class design presented in a class diagram and/or algorithm design illustrated in pseudocode or a flow chart), and a description of how to implement data structure operations: sorting and searching.

## Submission📥

### Folder Structure
You must place your file in the submission folder. Within the `submission` folder, create a folder called your  `group_name`. Suggested folder structure for the DSA tasks:

```
📁Submission/sec01/group_name
├── 📄readme.md
└── 📁files
    ├── 📁images
    └── 📁source-code
        ├── 📁images
        └── 📁source-code

```
The folder structure you provided appears to be organized in a hierarchical manner. Here's a description of each component:

- `group_name` is your folder or repository name.
- `readme.md` is a markdown file that serves as the readme for the repository. It usually contains information about the task, workflow, design, and documentation.

Inside the `group_name` folder, there is directory named `files`. Inside the `files` directory, you'll find two subdirectories:
  - `images` directory holds image files that are referenced or used within the task or any associated documentation.
  - `source-code` directory contains source code files related to the task, or input files if any.

In summary, this folder structure appears to be organizing a GitHub repository by dividing it into separate sections for different classes. Each task has its own directory, including the md file, along with subdirectories for related files, such as images and source codes.
