# Restaurant Management System

## Description üìù

Restaurant Management System is a system that helps a restaurant to take orders within the physical restaurant setting. Compared to taking order by writing it down on a piece of paper, this system is time saving as the food ordered will be directly sent to the kitchen. Waiters will also get alert on which table are waiting their food. This system will capture customer orders, and table reservations and generate bills for the payment process. The system will also manage any changes within the food menus and changes will be updated in the system.
